/**
 * ### Challenge `processFirstItem`
 * 
 * @instructions
 * Implement a higher-order function called `processFirstItem`.
 * It takes two arguments:
 * @param stringList an array of strings.
 * @param callback function that takes a string as its argument.
 * @returns the result of invoking `callback` with the FIRST element in `stringList`.
 * 
 * Example of usage of this higher-order function:
 * Invoking `processFirstItem` passing `['foo', 'bar']` and `(str) => str + str`,
 * should return 'foofoo'.

/* Task 1: `counterMaker`
 * Study the code for counter1 and counter2. Answer the questions below.
 * 
 * 1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
 * They both have the same value since the count is incremented after execution, not before, and in both cases the count had been set to 0.
 * 
 * 2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
 * counter2 uses a closure as it must reach beyond the function to get it's value.
 * 
 * 3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would counter2 be better? 
 *counter1 is preferable if the variable count might be used elsewhere. It's scope within the function isolates count.
 counter2 is preferable if there is a need to set an initial value on count externally.

/* Task 2: inning() 

Write a function called `inning` that returns a random number of points that a team scored in an inning. This should be a whole number between 0 and 2. */

/* Task 3: finalScore()

Write a higher order function called `finalScore` that accepts the callback function `inning` (from above) and a number of innings and and returns the final score of the game in the form of an object.

For example, 

finalScore(inning, 9) might return:

  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5,
}

/* Task 4: 

Create a function called `scoreboard` that accepts the following parameters: 

(1) Callback function `getInningScore`
(2) Callback function `inning`
(3) A number of innings

and returns the score at each pont in the game, like so:
1st inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
2nd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
3rd inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
4th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
5th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
6th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
7th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
8th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
9th inning: awayTeam - homeTeam
Final Score: awayTeam - homeTeam */
